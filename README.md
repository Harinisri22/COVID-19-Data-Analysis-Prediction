# COVID-19 Data Analysis & Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data and predicting recovery outcomes using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning** techniques. The main goal is to understand the patterns in the data, clean and preprocess it, visualize key trends, and finally build a predictive model to classify recovery levels.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
- To perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on COVID-19 datasets.  
- To understand the impact of new cases, deaths, and recoveries.  
- To classify recovery outcomes into categories (Low, Medium, High).  
- To apply **Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)** for predicting recovery patterns.  
- To evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## 📂 Workflow
1. **Data Import & Cleaning**  
   - Loaded Excel-based COVID-19 dataset.  
   - Handled missing values and ensured proper data types.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, correlations).  
   - Data visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn.  
   - Identified trends in new cases, deaths, and recoveries.  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Created a new categorical feature `Recovery_Class` (Low, Medium, High).  
   - Transformed raw data into meaningful features for model building.  

4. **Machine Learning Model**  
   - Built a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict recovery outcomes.  
   - Trained and tested the model with dataset split (train/test).  
   - Achieved **95%+ accuracy** on test data. 🚀  

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated using confusion matrix & classification report.  
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score analyzed for model fairness.
