## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **COVID-19 case trends across Indian States/UTs** and predicts future case counts using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and multiple **Machine Learning** models.  
It covers the full workflow—**data cleaning ➜ visualization ➜ prediction ➜ insights**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project  
- Explore and visualize **daily trends** of confirmed, recovered, and death cases.  
- Create new features like **Active Cases, Month, Day** for deeper insights.  
- Predict **Total Cases, New Cases, and Active Cases** using ML models.  
- Compare **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, and **Linear Regression** based on R², MAE, and MSE.  

---

## 📂 Workflow  
1. **Data Import & Cleaning** – Loaded the Indian COVID-19 dataset, fixed negative values, converted dates.  
2. **EDA** – Correlation heatmaps, daily/monthly trends, top-state analysis, death vs. recovery comparisons.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Added `Active Cases`, `Month`, `Day`.  
4. **Model Building** –  
   - Train/Test split: 80/20  
   - Models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression  
   - Preprocessing: Label Encoding & Standard Scaling  
5. **Evaluation** – Calculated **MAE**, **MSE**, and **R² Score**; selected the best model automatically.

---

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Strong correlation among **Total Cases, Deaths, and Recoveries**.  
- Clear **time-based waves** of infection.  
- **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** achieved the best predictive performance.  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code  

---

## 📑 Dataset Information  
- Daily COVID-19 records of **Indian States/UTs**.  
- Columns include: *Date, State/UT, Total Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, New Cases, New Deaths, New Recovered*.  
- Data cleaned and enriched with additional features before modeling.  

---

## 📊 Results  
- Achieved **high R² scores (~95%)** for predicting Total, New, and Active Cases.  
- Built a **complete ML pipeline** from raw data to actionable insights.  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  
- Integrate **real-time COVID-19 APIs** for live predictions.  
- Experiment with **XGBoost**, **Neural Networks**, or **LSTM** for time-series forecasting.  
- Build a **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive visualization.  
- Extend to **global datasets** for wider applicability.
