## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data and predicting recovery outcomes using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning** techniques. The main goal is to clean and preprocess data, visualize key trends, and finally build a predictive model to classify recovery levels with high accuracy.  

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project  
- Perform **EDA** on COVID-19 datasets.  
- Understand the impact of new cases, deaths, and recoveries.  
- Classify recovery outcomes into categories (Low, Medium, High).  
- Apply **Random Forest Classifier** for prediction.  
- Evaluate performance with accuracy, confusion matrix & classification report.  

---

## 📂 Workflow  
1. **Data Import & Cleaning** – Loaded Excel dataset, handled missing values.  
2. **EDA** – Descriptive stats, correlations, visualizations.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Created `Recovery_Class` (Low, Medium, High).  
4. **Model Building** – Random Forest Classifier trained & tested.  
5. **Evaluation** – Achieved **95%+ accuracy**, confusion matrix & classification report.
